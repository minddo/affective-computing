## affective-computing

Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. 
It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, and cognitive science. While some core ideas in the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into emotion.

Affective computing is very important because emotion affect physiological and psychological status and and are closely related to health and work efficiency. So, emotion recognition has been applied in many areas:
* Safe driving
* Mental health monitoring
* Social security 
* Marketing
* Education
* Entertainment industries 

Recently, there are several studies about affectvie computing, they use picture or video of people ,voice and physiological sensor data to predict human emtion. Among them, I used sensor data becuase there are so many raw physiological signal due to advanced of wearable and mobile devices.


## Limitation using sensor data to predict emotion
Traditionally, people have made models using sensor data based on machine learning, but there are some limitations. Tranditional machine learning entailed feature extraction, and it hvave the burden of manually extracting hand craft features. And these approaches features may not be efficient to extract the complex pattern. 
Also the cost of labeling is too expensive and these approach have poor performance for new users due to personal bias

## Deep learning based model
To overcome these limitations, people used to utilize deep learning based model beacause it not need for hand crafted features and can find non-linear relationships.
In the future, I will apply the concept of meta-learning to solve the data scarcity and personalization problem.
